# Veni Vidi Project Playbook
*"I came, I saw, I connected"*

## 1. Profile & Vision

### Why We Exist
In today's interconnected world, two distinct challenges have emerged:
1. Travelers form meaningful connections globally but struggle to maintain them once they return home
2. People with diverse social circles find it increasingly difficult to maintain quality relationships across multiple friend groups

Traditional social networks fail to address these unique dynamics. Veni Vidi bridges this gap by creating an activity-centered platform that makes maintaining meaningful connections natural and effortless.

### Our Mission
To revolutionize how people maintain and strengthen their social connections through shared experiences and activities, making the world feel more connected and accessible - whether you're a global traveler or managing local friend groups.
